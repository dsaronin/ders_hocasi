%h3  Welcome to DrillTutor&trade;
%p   
  DrillTutor uses your personal language notes to construct Flashcards, 
  which it then displays to you as a sequence of drills.
%p
  DrillTutor is Topics-based allowing you to organize your
  notes around whatever Topics are meaningful to your language study.
  They could be grammatically based (adverbs, adjectives, plurals) or
  vocabulary based (careers, work, food, travel).
%p
  DrillTutor can use a variety of types: Topics, Sentences, Phrases,
  Opposites, Dialog, Readings, and Dictionary.
