%h3  Welcome to DrillTutor&trade;
%p   
  DrillTutor uses your personal language notes to construct Flashcards, 
  which you can use as drills to improve your language skills.
%p
  DrillTutor is Topics-based: organize your
  notes around whatever Topics are meaningful to your language study.
  Topics could be grammatically based (adverbs, adjectives, plurals) or
  vocabulary based (careers, work, food, travel).
%p
  DrillTutor uses a variety of source materials: Vocabulary, Sentences, 
  Phrases, Opposites, Dialog, Readings, and Dictionary. 
  Your notes can be integrated with audio recordings that can be
  played during a Flashcard drill.
%p
  The better your organization around a Topic, the more integrated 
  your experience will be and the more skill reenforcement you will
  achieve.
